## Development

### System Requirements
- <strong>Building the Backend: JSP and Servlets</strong>

The heart of Simple Shop beats with JSP and Servlets. JSP files handle dynamic content generation, presenting users with tailored product lists, cart details, and order history. Servlets, the invisible workhorses, process user interactions, perform database operations, and handle authentication. They ensure smooth data flow between the user interface and the backend data store.

- <strong>Ajax: Adding Interactivity</strong>

Simple Shop isn't just a static webpage; it's an interactive experience. Ajax bridges the gap between the user and the server, allowing for real-time updates without page refreshes. Adding products to the cart, removing them, or updating quantities happens seamlessly, thanks to Ajax magic!

- <strong>Data Persistence: Firebase in the Cloud</strong> 

Firebase, Google's cloud-based platform, takes care of data persistence in Simple Shop. User accounts, products, and orders are securely stored in the Firebase Realtime Database, readily accessible and scalable. This ensures data integrity and eliminates the need for managing a separate database server.

- <strong>JSTL: Templating for Efficiency</strong>

JSTL, the Java Server Pages Standard Tag Library, facilitates dynamic content generation in JSP files. It simplifies repetitive tasks like iterating through product lists, displaying user information, and formatting prices. JSTL code is concise and readable, making code maintenance a breeze.

- <strong>Bootstrap: Bringing it to Life</strong>

Bootstrap, the popular front-end framework, provides a responsive and visually appealing foundation for Simple Shop. From product layouts to checkout forms, Bootstrap's pre-styled components and grid system streamline UI development, ensuring a consistent and polished look across devices.

- <strong>CICD</strong>

To faster delivery, and intergration, Jenkins have bring out as a solution to Automates the build, test, and deployment process.

- <strong>Security Considerations</strong>

Authentication and user data security are paramount in any ecommerce project. Simple Shop implements secure user login and registration processes, ensuring user information remains confidential. Firebase's built-in security features further enhance data protection.
